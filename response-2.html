      <h1>Reading Response #2</h1>
      <p>This reading response was inspired by the writing "Hello World!" by Taeyoon Choi. The reading talked about the orgin of computers and how a computer is built. Taeyoon went on to talk about how computers and cities have a lot in common regarding design and function. She then raised the question, "Are cities computers for humans?" I liked this section in the reading, because it really put in perspective the way that a computer opporates and how we opporate with the world around us. </p>
